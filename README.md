# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

The work that Jennifer and I have been doing with the SellBy project has gone great and we have been asked to contribute to another project. This project analyzes Amazon Vine reviews, an invitation only program from Amazon that includes only the most helpful reviewers. A company like SellBy would connect with Amazon Vine by paying a small fee and to provide products to reveiwers who would be required to review the products. Specifically, through analysis of reviews, Jennifer and I looked at whether or not there is bias in reviews from Amazon Vine members.

## Results

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
In the dataset I chose, there were 0 instances of Vine reviews vs 403,807 reviews from non-Vine users.

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
My analysis found that 60.15% on non-Vine reviews were five-stars and 0% of Vine reviews.

## Summary
It does not seem that there is any indication of bias in this dataset, primarily because there just aren't any Vine reviews in the dataset. I suppose some additional analysis would need to be done on other datasets to determine if there is any bias or even if there is any merit to the Vine program.
